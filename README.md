Excersises and figures from "Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction" by Sutton and Barto

Some of the figures:

It doesn't look exactly like in Sutton (unlike all the other figures from chapter 2 which I got almost ideally the same). It turns out that the average return from those bandits over 1000 iterations have pretty big variance. I did average (the average reward) over 200 runs for each bandit and each parameter (I bet Sutton did it over 2000 runs, but I didn't want to wait this long..).
